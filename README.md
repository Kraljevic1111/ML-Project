# ML-Project

This project is about analyzing data to create model that will predict category of random product base on product title.

-In this analysis wee go in depth to analyze dataset with huge amount of data to create best model for predicting category of products
-First wee get to see the  data and then wee are doo analysis like shape of the data set,type of columns,info about dataset.
-After that wee doo some analyzis with certain columns too see if there is any correlation
-Next wee clear the data and standardize columns that wee are using in training model and creating new columns for better accuracy
-After all that wee create code that can predict category of product based on product title
